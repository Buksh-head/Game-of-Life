# Game-of-Life
A Python-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life, showcasing cellular automation principles and Turing completeness. The system supports animated simulations, pattern import from plaintext and run-length encoding (RLE), and features an efficient convolution-based rule computation for large grids. Designed to explore computational theory concepts.
